# Recursion-on-Matrix
Project for COP3530 Data Structures and Algorithms

ASSIGNMENT:

Write a program that uses a recursive algorithm to calculate the determinant of a matrix.  

The program should read a matrix, print it out, and calculate and print the determinant.

You must implement a matrix abstract data type. 

Your matrix implementation should be that of a "sparse" matrix.  

Only matrix elements that are non-zero should be allocated in memory.  

This means you cannot implement your matrix with a 2D array.
